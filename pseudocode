import java Swing GUI (add imports as you use them. Unused imports will cause an error line, a.k.a be useless.)

file1: traffic light and car Sim GUI 
details: -able to put current stamps in 1 second intervals
- Real-time Traffic Light display for three major intersections
-X, Y positions and speed of up to 3 cars as they traverse each of the 3 intersections

Requirements: 

- Components listed above should run in seperate threads. 
- Loop through the simulation with button(s) that can START, PAUSE, STOP, and continue on with simulation
- Distance formulas will be used e.g: distance = Speed * time. Define all units of measure no acronyms type out mile/hour, or kilometer/hour not km/h or m/h
- Distance between each light is 1000meters ( IS A COMPLETE STRAIGHT LINE) 
- Y = 0 for your x,y positions. 
- no physics is required, Cars will stop immeditately on red light, and run through yellow and green lights. 

For me: 
Possible GUI SWING options: 
-GRAPH, LAYOUT, FLOWCHART   OR   Hard code panel corridinates and buttons
-Use array options in order to do display code in a signification way.


Possible way to display x,y, and seped of 3 cars:
-Add datatable and displays in array format. 

How to display the cars traveling along the rode:
Using a slider to show


Hard code option 
Steps: 
- Create GUI WINDOW WITH LABELS BEFORE GIVING FUNCTIONS. 
- Label Buttons. 
- GUI needs to be able to store and edit informtion, create an array. 
-
